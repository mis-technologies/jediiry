          I am the founder of Spoint Nigeria, a fintech company focused on building secure, scalable, and user‑centric financial solutions for emerging markets. The Spoint product is currently under active development and will leverage blockchain technology at its core to ensure transparency, security, and trust across financial interactions.
          <br /><br />
          In addition to leading product direction and engineering strategy at Spoint, I also serve as a Developer Advocate for Polygon, where I support developers, promote blockchain adoption, and contribute to the growth of the Web3 ecosystem.
          <br /><br />
          Alongside these leadership roles, I bring over eight years of experience as a software and platform engineer, delivering high‑impact solutions across multiple industries. My expertise spans platform engineering, cloud‑native development, blockchain technologies, and AI engineering—enabling me to architect and build resilient systems, intelligent applications, and modern distributed platforms.
          <br /><br />
          Throughout my career, I have led and contributed to projects ranging from mobile applications to enterprise‑grade infrastructures, consistently driving innovation, improving performance, and solving complex engineering challenges. I remain deeply committed to creating technology that delivers real‑world value and continuously expand my skillset to stay ahead of emerging tools, frameworks, and architectural practices.
          <br /><br />
          My journey reflects a blend of technical excellence, leadership, and forward‑thinking engineering—qualities aligned with global‑level talent in today’s technology landscape.
